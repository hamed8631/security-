###############################################################################

# TAG: ppp
#	Path to the pppd program, default '/usr/sbin/pppd' on Linux
#
#ppp /usr/sbin/pppd

# TAG: option
#	Specifies the location of the PPP options file.
#	By default PPP looks in '/etc/ppp/options'
#
option /etc/ppp/options.pptpd

# TAG: debug
#	Turns on (more) debugging to syslog
#
#debug

# TAG: stimeout
#	Specifies timeout (in seconds) on starting ctrl connection
#
# stimeout 10

# TAG: noipparam
#       Suppress the passing of the client's IP address to PPP, which is
#       done by default otherwise.
#
#noipparam

# TAG: logwtmp
#	Use wtmp(5) to record client connections and disconnections.
#
logwtmp

# TAG: vrf <vrfname>
#	Switches PPTP & GRE sockets to the specified VRF, which must exist
#	Only available if VRF support was compiled into pptpd.
#
#vrf test

# TAG: bcrelay <if>
#	Turns on broadcast relay to clients from interface <if>
#
#bcrelay eth1

# TAG: delegate
#	Delegates the allocation of client IP addresses to pppd.
#
#       Without this option, which is the default, pptpd manages the list of
#       IP addresses for clients and passes the next free address to pppd.
#       With this option, pptpd does not pass an address, and so pppd may use
#       radius or chap-secrets to allocate an address.
#
#delegate

# TAG: connections
#       Limits the number of client connections that may be accepted.
#
#       If pptpd is allocating IP addresses (e.g. delegate is not
#       used) then the number of connections is also limited by the
#       remoteip option.  The default is 100.
#connections 100

# TAG: localip
# TAG: remoteip
#	Specifies the local and remote IP address ranges.
#
#	These options are ignored if delegate option is set.
#
#       Any addresses work as long as the local machine takes care of the
#       routing.  But if you want to use MS-Windows networking, you should
#       use IP addresses out of the LAN address space and use the proxyarp
#       option in the pppd options file, or run bcrelay.
#
#	You can specify single IP addresses seperated by commas or you can
#	specify ranges, or both. For example:
#
#		192.168.0.234,192.168.0.245-249,192.168.0.254
#
#	IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS:
#
#	1. No spaces are permitted between commas or within addresses.
#
#	2. If you give more IP addresses than the value of connections,
#	   it will start at the beginning of the list and go until it
#	   gets connections IPs.  Others will be ignored.
#
#	3. No shortcuts in ranges! ie. 234-8 does not mean 234 to 238,
#	   you must type 234-238 if you mean this.
#
#	4. If you give a single localIP, that's ok - all local IPs will
#	   be set to the given one. You MUST still give at least one remote
#	   IP for each simultaneous client.
#
# (Recommended)
localip 192.168.1.18
remoteip 192.168.1.1-238,192.168.1.245
# or
#localip 192.168.0.234-238,192.168.0.245
#remoteip 192.168.1.234-238,192.168.1.245

# Sample Poptop PPP options file /etc/ppp/options.pptpd
# Options used by PPP when a connection arrives from a client.
# This file is pointed to by /etc/pptpd.conf option keyword.
# Changes are effective on the next connection.  See "man pppd".
#
# You are expected to change this file to suit your system.  As
# packaged, it requires PPP 2.4.2 and the kernel MPPE module.
###############################################################################


# Authentication

# Name of the local system for authentication purposes 
# (must match the second field in /etc/ppp/chap-secrets entries)
name pptpd

# Strip the domain prefix from the username before authentication.
# (applies if you use pppd with chapms-strip-domain patch)
#chapms-strip-domain


# Encryption
# (There have been multiple versions of PPP with encryption support,
# choose with of the following sections you will use.)


# BSD licensed ppp-2.4.2 upstream with MPPE only, kernel module ppp_mppe.o
# {{{
refuse-pap
refuse-chap
refuse-mschap
# Require the peer to authenticate itself using MS-CHAPv2 [Microsoft
# Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol, Version 2] authentication.
require-mschap-v2
# Require MPPE 128-bit encryption
# (note that MPPE requires the use of MSCHAP-V2 during authentication)
require-mppe-128
# }}}


# OpenSSL licensed ppp-2.4.1 fork with MPPE only, kernel module mppe.o
# {{{
#-chap
#-chapms
# Require the peer to authenticate itself using MS-CHAPv2 [Microsoft
# Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol, Version 2] authentication.
#+chapms-v2
# Require MPPE encryption
# (note that MPPE requires the use of MSCHAP-V2 during authentication)
#mppe-40	# enable either 40-bit or 128-bit, not both
#mppe-128
#mppe-stateless
# }}}


# Network and Routing

# If pppd is acting as a server for Microsoft Windows clients, this
# option allows pppd to supply one or two DNS (Domain Name Server)
# addresses to the clients.  The first instance of this option
# specifies the primary DNS address; the second instance (if given)
# specifies the secondary DNS address.
ms-dns 4.2.2.4
ms-dns 8.8.8.8

# If pppd is acting as a server for Microsoft Windows or "Samba"
# clients, this option allows pppd to supply one or two WINS (Windows
# Internet Name Services) server addresses to the clients.  The first
# instance of this option specifies the primary WINS address; the
# second instance (if given) specifies the secondary WINS address.
#ms-wins 10.0.0.3
#ms-wins 10.0.0.4

# Add an entry to this system's ARP [Address Resolution Protocol]
# table with the IP address of the peer and the Ethernet address of this
# system.  This will have the effect of making the peer appear to other
# systems to be on the local ethernet.
# (you do not need this if your PPTP server is responsible for routing
# packets to the clients -- James Cameron)
proxyarp

# Normally pptpd passes the IP address to pppd, but if pptpd has been
# given the delegate option in pptpd.conf or the --delegate command line
# option, then pppd will use chap-secrets or radius to allocate the
# client IP address.  The default local IP address used at the server
# end is often the same as the address of the server.  To override this,
# specify the local IP address here.
# (you must not use this unless you have used the delegate option)
#10.8.0.100


# Logging

# Enable connection debugging facilities.
# (see your syslog configuration for where pppd sends to)
#debug

# Print out all the option values which have been set.
# (often requested by mailing list to verify options)
#dump


# Miscellaneous

# Create a UUCP-style lock file for the pseudo-tty to ensure exclusive
# access.
lock

# Disable BSD-Compress compression
nobsdcomp 

# Disable Van Jacobson compression 
# (needed on some networks with Windows 9x/ME/XP clients, see posting to
# poptop-server on 14th April 2005 by Pawel Pokrywka and followups,
# http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=111343175400006&r=1&w=2 )
novj

# turn off logging to stderr, since this may be redirected to pptpd, 
# which may trigger a loopback

# put plugins here 
# (putting them higher up may cause them to sent messages to the pty)
